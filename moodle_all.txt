SUMMARY:Michael Madaio presentation
DESCRIPTION:"Human-Centered Approaches to Fairness in AI"\n\nAs AI systems 
	become increasingly ubiquitous in consumer technology and in high-stakes co
	ntexts\, such as education\, healthcare\, and more\, there is a growing awa
	reness that AI systems may disproportionately harm marginalized groups. To 
	address this\, researchers have developed principles\, toolkits\, and metri
	cs to support fairness in AI\, yet these approaches are often divorced from
	 the situated contexts in which AI systems are developed and used. In this 
	talk\, I will discuss two research projects with AI industry practitioners 
	to co-design and use resources to support fairness in AI design. I will sha
	re insights into how these resources—an AI fairness checklist and a process
	 for disaggregating AI model evaluations to uncover performance disparities
	—both shape and are shaped by the organizational contexts in which AI syste
	ms are produced. Finally\, I will conclude with future directions for this 
	research\, including work in progress to understand how impacted communitie
	s and other stakeholders may meaningfully participate in the work of AI fai
	rness.\n\nBio: Michael Madaio is a postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Res
	earch working with the FATE research group (Fairness\, Accountability\, Tra
	nsparency\, and Ethics in AI). He works at the intersection of human-comput
	er interaction and algorithmic fairness\, focusing on enabling more fair an
	d responsible AI through research with AI practitioners and people impacted
	 by AI systems. Madaio received his PhD in Human-Computer Interaction from 
	Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nURL: https://ischool.illinois.edu/news-event

SUMMARY:CFG Seminar: A Study on Crowd-AI Interaction towards Fair Human Fac
	e Applications
	
DESCRIPTION:PhD student Ziyi Kou will lead the session\, "A Study on Crowd-
	AI Interaction towards Fair Human Face Applications"\n\nAbstract: Human fac
	e images represent a rich set of visual data information that is utilized b
	y various data-driven human facial applications. However\, the performance 
	of these applications is usually biased towards the majority demographic gr
	oup due to the data imbalance issue. To solve the fairness problem\, curren
	t approaches usually require pre-annotated demographic labels of human face
	 images and focus on developing application-specific machine learning (ML) 
	models that cannot be easily generalized to other ML applications. In this 
	talk\, we will discuss the crowd-AI interaction strategies that generate fa
	ir human face datasets to improve both the fairness and accuracy performanc
	e of human facial applications optimized on such datasets. The talk consist
	s of two case studies. In the first study\, we discuss a fair crowdsourcing
	-based data sampling framework that leverages an efficient batch-level demo
	graphic label inference model and a joint fair-accuracy-aware data shufflin
	g method to sample a fair sub-dataset from a large human face dataset with 
	demographic biases. In the second study\, we discuss a crowdsourcing-based 
	fair data exchange framework to generate a set of augmented fair face image
	 datasets by leveraging the crowdsourced demographic attribute labels of hu
	man face images. Both case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of crowdso
	urcing strategies to reduce various demographic biases of human face datase
	ts and develop fairness-aware human facial applications.\n\nReadings:\n[1]

SUMMARY:Jiaqi Ma presentation
DESCRIPTION:"Towards Trustworthy Machine Learning on Graph Data"\nAbstract:
	 Machine learning on graph data (a.k.a. graph machine learning) has attract
	ed tremendous attention from both academia and industry\, with many success
	ful applications ranging from social recommendation to traffic forecasting\
	, even including high-stake scenarios. However\, despite the huge empircal 
	success in common cases\, popular graph machine learning models often have 
	degraded performance in certain conditions. Given the complexity and divers
	ity of real-world graph data\, it is crucial to understand and optimize the
	 model behaviors in specific contexts.\nIn this talk\, I will introduce my 
	recent work on analyzing the robustness and fairness of graph neural networ
	ks (GNNs). In the first part of the talk\, I will show that existing GNNs c
	ould suffer from model misspecification\, due to an implicit conditional in
	dependence assumption. This observation motivates our design of a copula-ba
	sed learning framework that improves upon many existing GNNs. In the second
	 part\, I will go beyond average model performance and investigate the fair
	ness of GNNs. Through a generalization analysis on GNNs\, I will show that 
	there is a predictable disparity in GNN performance among different subgrou
	ps of test nodes. I will also discuss potential mitigation strategies.\nBio
	: Jiaqi Ma is a PhD candidate in School of Information at the University of
	 Michigan. His research interests lie in machine learning and data mining. 
	He has worked in the areas of graph machine learning\, multi-task learning\
	, learning-to-rank\, and recommender systems during his PhD study and inter
	nships with Google Brain. His work has been published in top AI journals an
	d conferences\, including JMLR\, ICLR\, NeurIPS\, KDD\, WWW\, AISTATS\, etc

SUMMARY:Elizabeth Bondi presentation
DESCRIPTION:Title: Translating AI to Impact: Uncertainty and Human-agent In
	teractions in Multi-agent Systems for Public Health and Conservation\nAI is
	 now being applied widely in society\, including to support decision-making
	 in important\, resource-constrained efforts in conservation and public hea
	lth. Such real-world use cases introduce new challenges\, like noisy\, limi
	ted data and human-in-the-loop decision-making. I show that ignoring these 
	challenges can lead to suboptimal results in AI for social impact systems. 
	For example\, previous research has modeled illegal wildlife poaching using
	 a defender-adversary security game with signaling to better allocate scarc
	e conservation resources. However\, this work has not considered detection 
	uncertainty arising from noisy\, limited data. In contrast\, my work addres
	ses uncertainty beginning in the data analysis stage\, through to the highe
	r-level reasoning stage of defender-adversary security games with signaling
	. I introduce novel techniques\, such as additional randomized signaling in
	 the security game\, to handle uncertainty appropriately\, thereby reducing
	 losses to the defender. I show similar reasoning is important in public he
	alth\, where we would like to predict disease prevalence with few ground tr
	uth samples in order to better inform policy\, such as optimizing resource 
	allocation. In addition to modeling such real-world efforts holistically\, 
	we must also work with all stakeholders in this research\, including by mak
	ing our field more inclusive through efforts like my nonprofit\, Try AI.\nB
